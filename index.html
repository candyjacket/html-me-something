        <h2>A Lifechanging Encounter</h2>
        <h4>December 31, 1999</h4>
        <p>'Twas the night before Y2K, the way I would be entering the millenium would be the most important moment in the history of humanity. This would be the night where I discovered the Morsels of Knowledge for the first time. My flight to Antarctica arrived just in time to take the submarine transport to the show. I didn't even know who we'd be watching, just that it would be the most incredible performance in history. As the clock struck twelve, the curtains dropped and the Morsels began to play. Words cannot begin to describe how breathtaking what I experienced was.</p>

        <h2>Going To The School of Knowledge</h2>
        <h4>May 7th, 2006</h4>
        <p>About six years after the first time I witnessed the Morsels and after doing extensive research on them, I discovered the Schools of Knowledge. These are worldwide instituions that are dedicated to the study of the Morsels and their ways. After submitting my application to the school and being denied seven times, they finally allowed me to attend. I would share more details but it would cost me my life.

          <h2>Becoming a Morsel</h2>
          <p>After nearly 13 grueling years of intensive studying and vigorous martial arts exercises, the Morsels communicated telepathically to inform me that I was on the verge of becoming a Morsel but there was one final test that must be passed. Long story short, through sheer will and dedication I barely failed. The Morsels said that I was to never show my face around them again.

            <p>Luckily, after a few months of tireless nights I was notified via snail mail that I had actually been selected to join the Morsels of Knowledge on their 2019 Mental World Tour. Checkout the dates below...</p>
